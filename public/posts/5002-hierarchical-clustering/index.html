Agglomerative methods
It begin from clusters based on each data point to a big cluster containing all the data point
Divisive Methods
From big cluster containing all the data point to cluster containing one data point.

Distance

Single Linkage: The nearest distance between two point in two cluster
Complete Linkage: The distance between two cluster is given by the distance between their most distant members
Group Average Linkage: The average of the distance between all pairs of records (pair-wise)
Centroid Linkage: The distance is defined as the distance between the mean vector of two cluster
Median Linkage: The mid-point of the original two cluster cetnres is used as the centre of the new combined group. To avoid the characteristic properties of the small one are lost.

<li>We find the shortest distance between two cluster-&gt; 2.0 between 1 and 2.</li>
<li>We use the closest distance as the new distance, etc.</li>

<h1 id="divisive-approach">Divisive Approach</h1>
<h2 id="polythetic-approach">Polythetic Approach</h2>
<p>It uses all the attributes to do clustering</p>
<h3 id="procedure">Procedure</h3>
<p>In the begining, we select each point in the whole cluster, to form a new cluster, and measure the distance between these two cluster.</p>
<p>We select the cluster with greatest distance as new cluster A. The cluster containing other data points is called cluster B.</p>
<p>After that, we select one point a (one by one) from B, and measure the distance between A, and B/a, and measure the delta of distance of A and B/a.</p>
<p>We select the one with the greatest delta to put into A.</p>
<p>We continue this, until all delta become negative.</p>
<h3 id="note">Note</h3>
<p><em>We can continue to do this on each sub group to get more cluster</em></p>

<h3 id="chi-square-measure">Chi-Square Measure</h3>
<p>![[Pasted image 20250516143935.png]]
note: ad and bc is cross product.  a + b &hellip; is row and column-wise addition.</p>
<h3 id="do-clustering">Do clustering</h3>
<p>![[Pasted image 20250516144020.png]]
We use the chi-square to get the one with greatest impact.
For example, for A: $\chi_{AB}^2 + \chi_{AC}^2$
for B: $\chi_{AB}^2 + \chi_{BC}^2$
etc&hellip;</p>
<p>We select the most impact one, and cluster by the value.
For example, the most impact one is attribute A. We split the whole group into {2, 3, 4} and {1, 5} due to they get same value 0 or 1.</p>
