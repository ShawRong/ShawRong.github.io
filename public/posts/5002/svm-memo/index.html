We can generalize this problem as this:
$$
\begin{align}
\min w_1^2 &#43; w_2^2 \
\text{subject to } y(w_1x_1&#43;w_2x_2&#43;b) \geq 1
\end{align}
$$
Why minimizing this term?
Because we want to maximize the distance D between two line. The D is involved in w by $\frac{w}{D}$.
Why transform maximizing to minimizing?
We want to transform the objective function from a non-linear form to a quadratic form.
Then, the problem becomes a form of quadratic programming which has many existing efficient techniques for that.">
