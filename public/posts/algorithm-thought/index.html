   <meta name="description" content="Two aspect of Doing Algorithm
There are two component of solving problem related to algorithms.
The first component is how to implement you thought. Even though you get a clear and simple way for solving algorithm problem in your mind, you still need to implement it into code. But it need practice to write a clear and right code for the algorithm in your mind.
The second part is how to get the way for solving algorithm problem. It&rsquo;s more about reading and watching related books or lectures.">

<p>I think doing the same algorithm problem once upon a time can helps to improve the skills for coding(the first component).</p>
