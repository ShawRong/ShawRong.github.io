I felt very tired after a day long walking. I can fall asleep very fast when I lay flat on my bed.
I am curious why I can't achieve the same effect after a day long work.
Even I work very long time in the daytime, I still struggle to fall asleep.
I think it's the result of insufficient usage of brain.
We need long-time full usage of brain, call aerobic brain working.
And we need anaerobic brain working, too.
