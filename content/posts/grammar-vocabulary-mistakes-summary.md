# Grammar and Vocabulary Mistakes Summary

This document summarizes grammar, vocabulary, and style mistakes found in the blog posts for future reference and improvement.

## Grammar Mistakes

### 1. Subject-Verb Disagreement
**File**: `CSAPP Memo.md`
- **Error**: "It's a lot of different things, but we can describe them as a whole abstract thing"
- **Correction**: "They are a lot of different things, but we can describe them as one abstract thing"
- **Issue**: "Things" is plural, so should use "they are" not "it's"

### 2. Missing Articles & Incorrect Word Forms
**File**: `CSAPP Memo.md`
- **Error**: "It passes message base on a uniform width"
- **Correction**: "It passes messages based on a uniform width"
- **Issue**: "Messages" should be plural, and "based" not "base"

### 3. Preposition Errors
**File**: `Blackwell Note.md`
- **Error**: "comparing the old version of mma comes from hopper architecture"
- **Correction**: "comparing with the old version of mma from hopper architecture"
- **Issue**: Need "with" for comparison, and remove unnecessary "comes"

### 4. Incorrect Verb Usage
**File**: `Think Of Working method for brain.md`
- **Error**: "I can fall asleep very fast when I lay flat on my bed"
- **Correction**: "I can fall asleep very fast when I lie flat on my bed"
- **Issue**: "Lie" (to recline) vs "lay" (to place something)

### 5. Capitalization
**File**: `Cuda Memo.md`
- **Error**: "this function is synchronous" (sentence beginning)
- **Correction**: "This function is synchronous"
- **Issue**: Sentence should start with capital letter

## Vocabulary Issues

### 1. Incorrect Word Choice
**File**: `CSAPP Memo.md`
- **Error**: "This is trivial" (referring to a complex process)
- **Correction**: "This is inefficient" or "This is cumbersome"
- **Issue**: "Trivial" means unimportant, not inefficient

### 2. Imprecise Technical Terms
**File**: `Blackwell Note.md`
- **Error**: "frees the workload of the other thread"
- **Correction**: "reduces the workload on the other threads"
- **Issue**: "Frees" is not appropriate; "reduces" or "eliminates" is better

### 3. Informal Language in Technical Context
**File**: `CSAPP Memo.md`
- **Error**: "to do this dirty work"
- **Correction**: "to handle this task" or "to perform this operation"
- **Issue**: "Dirty work" is too informal for technical documentation

### 4. Word Confusion
**File**: `Think Of Working method for brain.md`
- **Error**: "sense of small"
- **Correction**: "sense of smell"
- **Issue**: Wrong word used (small vs smell)

## Style Issues

### 1. Inconsistent Terminology
**File**: `MPI Memo.md`
- **Error**: Uses both "dest_process" and "dest_proc"
- **Correction**: Use "dest_proc" consistently
- **Issue**: Technical documentation should use consistent terminology

### 2. Unclear Pronoun References
**File**: `Blackwell Note.md`
- **Error**: "So in conclusion, the difference lies in:"
- **Correction**: "So in conclusion, the difference between WGMMA and UMMA lies in:"
- **Issue**: Make clear what "the difference" refers to

### 3. Awkward Phrasing
**File**: `Algorithm Thought.md`
- **Error**: "Even though you get a clear and simple way for solving algorithm problem in your mind"
- **Correction**: "Even if you have a clear and simple approach to solving algorithmic problems in mind"
- **Issue**: More natural phrasing and proper pluralization

### 4. Incomplete Sentences/Examples
**File**: `5002-Decision-Tree-Memo.md`
- **Error**: "P(tail) = 1    P(tail) = 0    entropy = "
- **Correction**: "P(head) = 1, P(tail) = 0, entropy = 0"
- **Issue**: Complete the example and fix logical inconsistency

### 5. Redundant/Unclear Expressions
**File**: `Study Research Note.md`
- **Error**: "use weight decay, non-proportionate for sparsity"
- **Correction**: "weight decay is not suitable for sparsity"
- **Issue**: The original phrasing is confusing and redundant

## Summary Statistics

- **Total Issues Found**: 16 major issues
- **Grammar Mistakes**: 5 instances

3. **Reference**: Use this document as a checklist when editing existing content
4. **Consistency**: Create a style guide for technical terminology used frequently
