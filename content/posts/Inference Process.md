## Understanding Q, K, V in Attention

### What Each Represents

- **Query (Q)**: "What information do I need?" - Search request
- **Key (K)**: "What information do I have?" - Advertisement/label
- **Value (V)**: "Here's the actual information" - Content payload

### How They Work Together

1. **Q × K**: Compute attention weights (who should attend to whom)
2. **Softmax**: Normalize attention weights
3. **Attention × V**: Weighted sum of values (what information gets mixed)

### Training Perspective

- **W_q, W_k, W_v**: Three learned transformation matrices
- **Same input**: Gets transformed three different ways for different purposes
- **Learning**: Model learns these matrices to solve language modeling task

### Example

```
Token "queen" input: [0.5, 0.8, 0.2, 0.9, ...]

After transformations:
Q = [0.000001, 1, 3, ...] # "I need person/musician info, not royal info"
K = [100, 2, 4, ...]      # "I'm very relevant for royal queries"
V = [1, 2, 3, ...]        # "I contain: royal=1, person=2, musician=3"
```

## LLM Inference Process

### Two-Phase Approach

#### Phase 1: Prefilling

- **Purpose**: Process entire input prompt
- **Method**: All tokens processed simultaneously (parallel)
- **Output**: Build initial KV cache, generate first response token
- **Speed**: Fast due to parallelization

#### Phase 2: Decoding

- **Purpose**: Generate response tokens one by one
- **Method**: Sequential processing, append to KV cache
- **Output**: Complete response
- **Speed**: Slower due to sequential nature

### Complete Example

```
Input: "System: You are helpful. User: What is the capital of France?"

Prefilling:
- Process all 17 input tokens at once
- Build KV cache: [17 × hidden_size]
- Generate first token: "The"

Decoding:
Time 1: Add "The" → Cache: [18 × hidden_size] → Generate "capital"
Time 2: Add "capital" → Cache: [19 × hidden_size] → Generate "of"
Time 3: Add "of" → Cache: [20 × hidden_size] → Generate "France"
...continue until complete response
```

## Key Insights Gained

1. **KV Cache is Essential**: Enables efficient autoregressive generation
2. **Pruning is Nuanced**: Different strategies (per-channel vs per-token) serve different purposes
3. **Output-Awareness is Smart**: Considers both stored information and current needs
4. **Q,K,V Have Distinct Roles**: Not just different values, but different purposes
5. **Inference Has Structure**: Prefilling vs decoding phases optimize for different constraints
6. **Everything Connects**: From training objectives to inference efficiency to pruning strategies

## Practical Applications

- **Memory Optimization**: Pruning reduces KV cache size for long sequences
- **Inference Acceleration**: Smaller cache = faster attention computation
- **Quality Preservation**: Smart pruning maintains model performance
- **Scalability**: Enables processing of longer contexts within memory constraints

This comprehensive understanding provides the foundation for working with modern LLM optimization techniques and understanding their trade-offs between efficiency and quality.
