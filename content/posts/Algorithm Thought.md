# Two aspect of Doing Algorithm
There are two component of solving problem related to algorithms.
The first component is how to implement you thought. Even though you get a clear and simple way for solving algorithm problem in your mind, you still need to implement it into code. But it need practice to write a clear and right code for the algorithm in your mind.
The second part is how to get the way for solving algorithm problem. It's more about reading and watching related books or lectures.

I think doing the same algorithm problem once upon a time can helps to improve the skills for coding(the first component).
